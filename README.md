# What is smart CAN

Suitable for the stm32f4xx series, smart CAN is an easy to use, robust, CAN implementation. You can easily add devices to use the CAN protocol and the code takes care of all the devices itself.

Here is what each branch contain
### Master:
Stable version of smart CAN
### experimental:
Cutting edge, development-in-progress version of smart CAN
### Stable(experimented):
Stable, but stability not guaranteed, newer than Master's version of smart CAN

# How to use Master branch (using the HERO_CAN project)

If you don't want to configure CAN yourself, you can use an existing template to build your project on.
Click this link for the project: [project](https://github.com/impeccableaslan/smart-CAN/tree/master/HERO_CAN).

# How to use Master branch (using your own project)

If you already have a project and just want to integrate CAN, then you would have to configure CAN yourself.

# More info
All of the above information provided simply tells you how to implement CAN, which is made even easier with smart CAN. But, if you want to actually learn CAN, or to explore ST-electronics HAL implementation of CAN, then start with visting https://impeccableaslan.github.io/communication_protocols/can/can.html
where you will learn lots about CAN and the CAN HAL library.
